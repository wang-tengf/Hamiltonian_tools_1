# Hamiltonian_tools_1
The first edition of the AI Hamiltonian construction software. Note that this version is suitable for quickly constructing the Hamiltonian of any material with the same accuracy as the DFT, but the constructed Hamiltonian can only be used for numerical calculations and has no physical significance in numerical terms.
